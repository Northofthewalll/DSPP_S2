# Predictive Analysis of Uk Small Businesses and Residential Fibre Using Time Series

## Executive Summary

The Uk government has set targets for fibre broadband to be available to 85% of the Uk by 2025 and nationwide 2030 (Clark, 2023). To check whether or not the government will meet this target, I will apply a time series model to the following data set provided from Ofcom (Ofcom, 2024). This outcome of this project is to determine whether or not Uk Governments target is realistic. The results could affect not only affect economic performance (Sanyika and Roxburgh, 2011) but also voter confidence in meeting targets.
To ensure the success of the project I will follow a proven model (Yu, 2021), which will help with ensuring the accuracy of the data. Furthermore, so that I make sure to select the best trend which not only looks good but is conservative alongside the historical data.
